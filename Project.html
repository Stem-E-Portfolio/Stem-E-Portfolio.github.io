1 in 5 people have a mental illness. Stigma from mental health issues is caused by people thinking that your condition will cause you to
do something wrong or dangerous. The world needs to remove the stigma of mental illness. One way to do this would be for people with the 
disorders to talk about there condition, but self-stigma is just as bad of a problem. The other solution for social stigma is to make 
mental illness lose its meaning and power by turning it meaningless. The way to do this is making jokes about people having conditions 
they don't have. So, by calling your friend who drinks 3 Starbucks a day addicted, call your overly happy friend manic, call the kid who 
likes cleaning OCD. The more a term is used, the less power it holds in your mind. This will help remove stigma by removing the 
association between mental illness and danger.
